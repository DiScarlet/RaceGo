Race Home

You are a Formula 1 driver returning from the Grand Prix when you get caught in the middle of a thunderstorm.
Your private jet can’t get you home safely.

With no other options left, you climb back into your Formula 1 car and get a very bold idea.

Avoid other drivers, buildings, and—most importantly—don’t crash.
Enjoy the ride.
