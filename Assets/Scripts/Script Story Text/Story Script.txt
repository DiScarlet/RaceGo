Idea: like Charles lecelerc and Carlos Sainz got to Monaco toghether bia rented bus instead of private jet 'cos of bed weather. 
Story: this is a game where you drive SF - 25 across the public road. You get home from grand prix. For now the game is infinite.
Goal: Drive as long as you could without crashing in normas cars and/or buildings and other elements across the street.
Task: to create a text that explains the overall idea of the game without naming any names.

The text:
You are a Formula driver. You’ve just finished a Grand Prix, but the journey isn’t over yet.
Due to no usual transport available, you take the only option you have left - the racing car - onto public roads and start the drive home.

Traffic, buildings, and everyday obstacles stand in your way. The road never ends, and one mistake means the trip is over.
How far can you go before the streets claim the car?
